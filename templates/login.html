<p><a href="http://notes.husk.org/post/7035845755/your-favourites-set-script">Paul Mison wrote a nice tool</a>
recently:</p>

<blockquote>
For a long time, Iâ€™ve maintained a set called Your Favourites on Flickr, which
contains those photos that lots of people have marked as, well, a favourite.
</blockquote>

<p>This is a web implementation of Paul's script. Give it rights to create
photosets, and it'll make you a set of up to 72 photos in your account that have
the favourites from other Flickr users, ordered by their popularity. (Why 72? 
It makes a nice rectangle on your set page). You'll need
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/me/stats/">Flickr stats</a> turned on 
(and hence a Pro account) for this to work, unfortunately.</p>

<p>favset is based on an <a href="http://notes.husk.org/post/7035845755/your-favourites-set-script">original
    script by Paul Mison</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp/">gae-flickrapp</a>
    framework by Aaron Straup Cope. It is hosted on <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>.</p>
